class MTDf:
    """
    This implements MTDbi algorithm. The following example shows
    how to setup the AI and play a Connect Four game:
    
        >>> from easyAI import Human_Player, AI_Player, MTDbi
        >>> AI = DUAL(7)
        >>> game = ConnectFour([AI_Player(AI),Human_Player()])
        >>> game.play()
    
    Parameters
    -----------
    
    depth:
      How many moves in advance should the AI think ?
      (2 moves = 1 complete turn)
    
    scoring:
      A function f(game)-> score. If no scoring is provided
         and the game object has a ``scoring`` method it ill be used.
    
    win_score:
      Score LARGER than the largest score of game, but smaller than inf. 
      It's required to run algorithm.
        
    tt:
      A transposition table (a table storing game states and moves)
      scoring: can be none if the game that the AI will be given has a
      ``scoring`` method.
      
    Notes
    -----
   
    The score of a given game is given by
    
    >>> scoring(current_game) - 0.01*sign*current_depth
    
    for instance if a lose is -100 points, then losing after 4 moves
    will score -99.96 points but losing after 8 moves will be -99.92
    points. Thus, the AI will chose the move that leads to defeat in
    8 turns, which makes it more difficult for the (human) opponent.
    This will not always work if a ``win_score`` argument is provided.
